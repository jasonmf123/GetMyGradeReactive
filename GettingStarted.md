# Getting started with Spring Reactive Web

Since some people wanted a list written by me and not just a link to the Spring tutorial, here it is. If you want to see more and learn how to code, please watch the videos by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVNIZXf4BG8&t=711s" >Josh Long</a>.

1. Go to <a href= "http://start.spring.io"> start.spring.io </a>
2. Select Reactive Web, Lombok and Reactive MongoDB as Dependencies.
3. Generate a Maven Project.
4. Save the downloaded ZIP folder and unpack it.
5. Open the pom.xml with your Java IDE (e.g. IntelliJ or Eclipse)
6. Enable auto-import of dependencies and download the dependencies in your IDE.
7. Start coding.

Spring will automatically provide you with a "main" class and a default test class.
